# TechWave HRM â€“ MERN Stack Web Application

Developed as part of the IT Project (ITP) module in 2nd year 2nd semester, TechWave HRM is a full-stack Human Resource Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

I was responsible for implementing the Employee Leave Request Management functionality, including:
- Leave submission
- Approval workflows
- Updating employee leave balances

This project strengthened my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and building user-centric interfaces in a collaborative environment.
